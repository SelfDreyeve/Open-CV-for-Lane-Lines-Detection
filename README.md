# Open-CV-for-Lane-Lines-Detection
In this repository, I store all the necessary notebooks in which I am experimenting with methods that can be applied to advanced lane detection.

I am currently working on an advanced lane detection project. In the notebooks stored in this repository, you will find various techniques used for processing road images. First of all, I created function that undistort images taken by a camera, then shift perspective to a bird's eye view. This enables to see the curvature of the road.

In another notebook I apply various thresholding techniques on different color spaces and channels to find the best one for detecting lanes even in difficult weather conditions.
